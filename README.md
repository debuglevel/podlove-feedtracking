Podlove Feedtracking
====================

Feedtracking is a simple Podlove module to track feeds with

  - Piwik
  - Google Analytics (not yet tested)

Issues
------
* Directories - of course this module will not track users using a proxy like iTunes or other directories.
* Directories - and of course not every download of the feed is necessary a human being, but might be some bot/indexer.
* Cache - if Podlove once supports caching the feed (or there is a caching proxy), this module will not work anymore.
* Piwik: IP - (for now) the IP is not recorded properly (instead the IP of your server or localhost is used)
* Google Analytics - untested. really.

Setup
-----
Access the Podlove Expert Settings and activate the stuff you need.
